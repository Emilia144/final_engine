Personal words:
As I already told you I still think both subjects are very interesting but absolutely not suited for Erasmus students that don't have the knowledge from the courses teaching the basics of game engines. I tried my best and really wanted to achieve something but in the end I barely understood what I was doing, which is making me quite unable to explain most of the used algorithms. I hope for you warn the exchange students of the coming years how hard it is going to be.
I must say I wish I could have attended more in the courses but working next to studies especially in another country can be quite time consuming and hard. I could not put in the effort that I now wish to have put in.
I am also sorry to bring you into this situation but I must beg you more or less to let me pass somehow even though my work is probably not enough for your usual standards. I can not afford to pay the Erasmus fees back if I don't pass the modules. 

Here you can find a cute dog asking for your pity.
